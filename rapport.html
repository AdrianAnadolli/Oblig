        I started the oblig by thinking about how I want my website to look like. 
        I decided that i wanted a fixed header that followed the screen, and in that header, 
        I would have easy navigation between the different sites. I also wanted my background to be an image, 
        preferably a fixed dark image with white text over it, which is one of the first things that I added to my website. 
        The text at default is black colored, and black colored text over a black background is almost impossible to see. 
        I fixed this issue by changing the color of the text to white in my CSS file, 
        under the html tag. I also tried to add eye friendly colors to my header. 
        I achieved this by adding CSS rules with the colors I wanted, 
        the first prototype of the website used a color palette that I got from the internet. 
        I wasnâ€™t very happy with how it looked so in the end I changed my colors and created my own palette.

        Another thing that I did what to align the text by using margins, 
        I also changed the size of the text to make it bigger and easier to read. 
        I used a website to find fonts that go well together, and in the end, 
        I decided to use Georgia and Helvetica as the fonts to my website. I made the paragraphs shorter by using
        br tag. This made the text easier to read and formatted the site. 
        Another thing that helped formatting the text was adding a max character length rule on my paragraphs.
        I also added abbreviations to the menu site, so that the user can read allergen descriptions without leaving the site.

        Later on my assignment I decided that I wanted to make my site easy to navigate with a keyboard. 
        I added a focus CSS rule and styled the focus to fit in with the design of the site. 
        A problem I ran into was that the focus tag would focus not only on the button, but also the a tag. 
        I used a lot of time browsing the internet for a solution to this. After a lot of browsing, 
        I found out that you can exclude a tag from using focus by adding tabindex="-1" inside the a tag.

        After I was done with that, I tried to test my website in the recommended testing websites. The results were the following:<br>
        https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/: Pass.<br>
        https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php: Pass.<br>
        https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator: Pass.
